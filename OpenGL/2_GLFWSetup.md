# GLFW Setup

- OpenGL is a cross platform Rendering API.
- Its not reponsible for interfacing with Platform's windowing system.
- In order to draw something we need a window (platform specific), for that we need Platform Native SDKs.


## Platform SDKs
- We can use Cocoa for Macos, NDK for Android, but this would too many options.
- But GLFW we can use for any platform
